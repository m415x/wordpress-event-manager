# Current operational handoff — WEM-2 Foundation

Status date: 2026-10-01. This is a work-in-progress handoff, not a completed-story record.

## Remote baseline
- Repository: `m415x/wordpress-event-manager`.
- Historical source baseline: `main@74116d06ccf40f3316cee7a33b034df45f8efa7b`.
- Integration branch: `dev`; active branch: `feat/WEM-2-foundation`.
- Project Jira: WEM. WEM-1 epic, WEM-2 story.
- WEM-3 completed a code inventory and stored findings in Jira. No product PHP modifications yet.
- WEM-4 is completed in Jira. The user pushed `.gitignore` via `bc2664b`; durable workflow documentation was subsequently added on the story branch.
- WEM-5 is in progress. The user reported GREEN of the standalone PHPUnit smoke test on PHP 8.3.35 / PHPUnit 11.5.56 (1 test, 4 assertions). `composer.lock` is now tracked on the feature branch. WordPress-backed integration test scaffolding and dedicated `.wp-env.test.json` have been committed remotely, but **not yet executed**.

## Observed local environment
- Windows with Git Bash, Node.js, pnpm, Docker Desktop.
- User started `wp-env` with PHP 8.3; WordPress dev reported at localhost:8888 and test at localhost:8889. These are local ephemeral ports/environments.
- User ran `wp-env run cli php -v` successfully, obtaining PHP 8.3.35.
- User ran `wp-env run cli wp plugin list`; WordPress boot terminated with a missing-class fatal. No plugin activation pass has been demonstrated.
- `.wp-env.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` were untracked locally at last user report; do not blindly add them. Reconcile and transition to pnpm in planned infrastructure task. Dedicated `.wp-env.test.json` is tracked remotely for integration isolation.

## Open blockers/debt
- Custom autoload filename mapping is inconsistent with class filenames.
- Six instantiated modules lack calls to hook/shortcode/menu setup functions. Tests must prove corrected wiring later.
- Anonymous AJAX handlers and nonce-only mutation guard are known security debt; avoid publishing legacy services publicly.
- Tickets are inferable and read/write access scoping is inadequate.
- Checkout/re-entry state is destructive, without full audit lineage.
- README makes unsupported claims about complete movement history and externally independent QR rendering.
- Legacy plugin identity has to be removed under WEM-8 with explicit compatibility/migration design; do not introduce its old identifiers into newly maintained files.

## Next work
1. Sync local feature branch with remote commits (`git pull --ff-only`).
2. Run WEM-5 isolated WordPress integration test via `.wp-env.test.json`, record actual result and diagnose unexpected bootstrap/config failures. `docs/testing.md` contains commands.
3. WEM-6 compact RED/GREEN commands; WEM-7 static gates/CI.
4. WEM-8 identity migration; WEM-9 legacy delta; WEM-10 closure and `dev` integration.
5. Preserve observed RED vs source-only findings vs genuinely executed verification.

Consult `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, current repository state, and full Jira tasks before changing scope.
